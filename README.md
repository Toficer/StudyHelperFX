# StudyHelperFX
## 13-OCT-2018
A flashcard app serving primarily as JavaFX/JDBC/CRUD practice for me and possibly as a nice tool for studying. The user can sort cards into decks and decks into folders which are all stored in an online database. Multiple types of cards are planned (simple text, multiple choice, image...).

Simple text and multiple choice cards can be added and the UI is mostly functional. Uploading as a backup.
NOTE: requires the user to supply and enter database details on compilation. TODO: add the ability to enter and modify database login credentials from within the app.
## CHANGELOG

* Some UI redesign, including descriptions and cards with answers
