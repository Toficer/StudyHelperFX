# StudyHelperFX
## 16-SEP-2018
A flashcard app serving primarily as JavaFX/JDBC/CRUD practice for me and possibly as a nice tool for studying. The user can sort cards into decks and decks into folders which are all stored in a database (TODO: online database). Multiple types of cards are planned (simple text, multiple choice, image...).

Simple text cards can be added and the UI is mostly functional. Uploading as a backup.
## CHANGELOG
### 16-SEP-2018
* Added multiple choice cards
* Added the ability to edit cards
### 14-SEP-2018
* Added basic input validation (empty fields, unwanted characters)
* Random cleanup, deleted some repeated code, simplified a few other parts
* Added the ability to move dialog windows
